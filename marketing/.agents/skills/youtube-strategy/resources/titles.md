A good **YouTube title** earns the click without lying. Simple as that.

### What actually works

**1. Clear outcome**

* Say what the viewer gets.
* If you can’t explain the payoff in one sentence, the title won’t work.

Examples:

* “Debug a Rails prod error in 10 minutes”
* “Why my Sony a6700 overheats on livestreams”

**2. Specific > clever**

* Precision beats wordplay.
* Numbers, tools, and constraints help.

Examples:

* “Claude Code vs MCP: when each breaks down”
* “Fix muffled audio in Premiere Pro (MV7+)”

**3. One idea only**

* One promise. One hook.
* No compound titles.

Bad:

* “AI agents, MCPs, and how I debug Rails apps”

Good:

* “MCP vs Agent Skills: what I actually use”

**4. Tension or contrast**

* Create a reason to click.
* Don’t manufacture drama.

Patterns that work:

* X vs Y
* Why X fails
* I stopped doing X
* This broke when I tried X

**5. Match the thumbnail**

* Title = context.
* Thumbnail = emotion or contrast.
* Don’t repeat text word-for-word.

**6. Front-load meaning**

* First 40–50 characters matter most.
* Mobile truncation is real.

**7. Honest, not clickbait**

* Overpromising hurts retention.
* Retention hurts reach.

### Practical checklist before publishing

* Can you predict the video from the title alone?
* Would *you* click this from a search result?
* Does it work without the thumbnail?
* Is the core idea in the first line?

### Formats that consistently perform

* “How I ___ without ___”
* “X vs Y for ___”
* “Why ___ keeps failing”
* “I tried ___ so you don’t have to”
* “The mistake I made with ___”
