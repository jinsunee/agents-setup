Here's what makes a good YouTube description:

**Structure (First to Last):**

1. **Opening Hook (First 2-3 lines)** - These show in search results and above "Show More". Restate the value proposition and include your main keyword. This is critical real estate.

2. **Detailed Overview** - Explain what the video covers in more depth. This helps viewers decide if it's worth their time and gives YouTube's algorithm context.

3. **Timestamps** - Break down sections with clickable timestamps. Viewers love these, and they increase watch time by letting people jump to what they need.

4. **Resources & Links** - Code repos, documentation, related videos, tools mentioned. Make it easy for viewers to go deeper.

5. **Call to Action** - Subscribe prompt, link to related content, mention your book/newsletter/other projects.

6. **Boilerplate** - About you, social links, standard disclaimers. Keep this consistent across videos.

**SEO Considerations:**

- **Front-load keywords naturally** - First 150 characters matter most for search
- **Include variations** - "Rails AI integration", "Ruby on Rails machine learning", "ActiveRecord with embeddings"
- **Use relevant hashtags** - 3-5 max, aligned with your content (#RubyOnRails #AIEngineering)
- **Link to related videos** - YouTube favors creators who keep viewers on platform

**UTM Parameters for Link Tracking:**

Add UTM parameters to newsletter and external links to track which videos drive traffic:

```
www.damiangalarza.com/newsletter?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=video&utm_campaign=[video-slug]
```

| Parameter | Value | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| `utm_source` | `youtube` | Identifies YouTube as the traffic source |
| `utm_medium` | `video` | Distinguishes from shorts, community posts, etc. |
| `utm_campaign` | `[video-slug]` | Tracks the specific video (e.g., `claude-code-tutorial`) |

**Tips:**
- Use lowercase, hyphenated video slugs for consistency
- Keep campaign names short but descriptive
- Use the same slug as your video file name for easy correlation

**For Technical Content:**

- **Prerequisites** - "You should know basic Rails and have API keys ready"
- **Code/repo links** - GitHub, gists, starter templates
- **Tool versions** - "Rails 8.0.1, Ruby 3.3.0, Claude Sonnet 4"
- **Additional resources** - Docs, papers, related tutorials
- **Corrections/updates** - Pin these at the top if something changed

**What to Avoid:**
- Keyword stuffing that reads unnaturally
- Walls of text with no formatting
- Outdated links or broken resources
- Overpromising what the video delivers
- Copying descriptions verbatim between videos

The description is valuable SEO real estate and viewer service - treat it as important as the video itself.
