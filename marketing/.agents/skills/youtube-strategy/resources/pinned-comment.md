# Creating Effective Pinned Comments

A pinned comment appears at the top of your comment section. It's your second CTA after the video—use it to direct attention, provide resources, or start discussion.

---

## Pinned Comment vs Description

| Aspect | Description | Pinned Comment |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Visibility** | Hidden behind "Show More" | Always visible at top |
| **Purpose** | SEO + context + resources | Engagement + conversation |
| **Tone** | Professional, structured | Conversational, personal |
| **Length** | Can be long | Under 100 words ideal |
| **Audience** | Viewers deciding to watch | Viewers who already watched |
| **Links** | Multiple organized links | 1-4 focused links max |

**Description = Reference Guide** (complete resources, timestamps, SEO)
**Pinned Comment = Conversation Starter** (one action, immediate value, discussion)

---

## The Pinned Comment Formula

A great pinned comment has **2-3 of these elements**:

1. **Clear purpose** - Why are you pinning this?
2. **Immediate value** - Something viewers want/need now
3. **Call to action** - What should they do?
4. **Personality** - Your authentic voice
5. **Scannability** - Readable in 3 seconds

## Five Core Pinned Comment Types

Choose based on what viewers need most after watching.

### Type 1: Resource
**Purpose:** Provide essential links, code, or documentation

```
🔗 Links from this video:

• GitHub repo: [link]
• API documentation: [link]
• Starter template: [link]

Stuck? Post your error below 👇
```

**When to use:** Tutorials, how-tos, any video with follow-along code

---

### Type 2: Correction / Update
**Purpose:** Fix errors or share breaking news

```
⚠️ Update:

At [timestamp], [what changed or what was wrong].

Corrected version: [link]

Anyone already hit this issue? 👇
```

**When to use:** Spotted an error, API changed, better solution found

---

### Type 3: Question
**Purpose:** Start technical discussion or gather feedback

```
💭 Question for you:

[Specific technical question directly related to video content]

How do you handle this? 👇
```

**When to use:** Opinion videos, comparisons, when you want community expertise

---

### Type 4: Challenge
**Purpose:** Get viewers to try the technique and report back

```
🛠️ Try this:

[Specific, actionable task from video]

Post your results below—best one gets
featured next week 👇
```

**When to use:** Tutorials with practical applications, experiments

---

### Type 5: Guardrail
**Purpose:** Set expectations, prevent common misunderstandings

```
⚠️ Scope note:

This is a [Rails-specific/beginner/advanced] approach.
[Key limitation or context].

[What this is NOT / what viewers shouldn't expect]
```

**When to use:** Controversial topics, niche approaches, content likely to be misinterpreted

**Variations:**
```
⚠️ Before you comment "just use X":
This video shows Y because [reason].
```

```
⚠️ Prerequisites:
You should already know: [Skill 1], [Skill 2]
Not covered: [Topic viewers might expect]
```

## Quick Decision Tree

**Ask:** "What do viewers need most after watching?"

- Need code/resources? → **Resource**
- Something's wrong/outdated? → **Correction/Update**
- Want discussion? → **Question**
- Want them to try it? → **Challenge**
- Anticipating confusion? → **Guardrail**

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO:

**Post within the first hour** - Early engagement signals boost algorithmic performance

**Make it immediately valuable** - Code repos, critical docs, important corrections

**Ask specific technical questions**
- "What's your caching strategy for [specific use case]?"
- NOT "What did you think?" (too vague)

**Use emojis as labels only** - 🔗 ⚠️ 💡 📊 (max 1-2, functional purpose)

**Keep it conversational** - "Hey! Quick thing I forgot to mention..." not "This video demonstrates..."

**Engage with replies** - Reply to thoughtful responses within 24 hours

**Update when needed** - New version? Better solution? Pin a new comment

### ❌ DON'T:

**Say "First!" or generic "Thanks for watching!"** - Wastes premium space

**Link dump** - Max 3-4 links, clearly labeled

**Over-promote** - One mention of newsletter = fine. Three CTAs = too many

**Copy-paste same comment on every video** - Customize for each video's value

**Ignore it after posting** - Set reminder to check replies

**Leave outdated info pinned** - Review weekly for technical content

---

## The Scannability Principle

**First 2-3 lines = Core value** (what they need to know/do now)
**Everything after = Optional depth** (supporting details)

```
🔗 Production-ready code: [link]

This fixes the timeout issue at 8:42.
Add retry logic + exponential backoff.

Why it works: [optional technical explanation]
```

**Test:** Can someone get the main point from first 2 lines only?

## Advanced Strategies

### The "Sequel Tease"
```
🚀 Coming next week:

I'm testing [specific comparison/experiment].
Early results are surprising...

What should I test? Drop ideas below! 👇
```

### The "Expert Callout"

📢 Calling all [specific expertise]:

Is there a better way to [challenge from video]?
I feel like I'm missing something. Prove me wrong! 👇
```

### The "Honest Failure"
```
🐛 Full transparency:

The approach at [timestamp] worked in tests
but failed in production because [reason].

Better solution: [link]
Learn from my mistakes 😅
```

## Real-World Examples

### Tutorial with Critical Resources
```
🔗 Everything you need to follow along:

• Starter repo: [link]
• Claude API key: [link]
• Deployment guide: [link]

Stuck on Step 3? Known issue with Ruby 3.2
—upgrade to 3.3+ to fix.

Questions? I'm here! 👇

### Important Update
```
⚠️ BREAKING: Claude Sonnet 4 just dropped

The API in this video (Opus) is now outdated.

## Timing Strategy

**Post immediately if your comment contains:**
- Required resources (repo links, dependencies)
- Known issues or critical fixes
- Scope clarification to prevent confusion

**Post later when you need to:**
- Respond to patterns in viewer confusion
- Address emerging debate
- Announce follow-up content

**Replace your pinned comment when:**
- Discussion shifts to a new focal point
- You discover a better solution
- Breaking news makes your approach outdated
