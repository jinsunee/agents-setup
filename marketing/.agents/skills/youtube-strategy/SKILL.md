# YouTube Strategy Skill

This skill helps with YouTube video creation from ideation through publishing. It covers the full workflow: validating ideas, crafting packaging (title + thumbnail + hook as a unified unit), and creating post-production elements like descriptions and pinned comments.

## How to Use This Skill

### 1. Identify the User's Stage

Before pulling in resources, determine where the user is in their process:

| Stage | User Signals | Primary Resources |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Ideation** | "I have an idea", "thinking about making a video", "should I make this?" | `ideation.md` |
| **Packaging** | "help with title", "thumbnail ideas", "working on my hook" | `titles.md`, `thumbnail.md`, `hook.md` (use together) |
| **Scripting** | "help with script", "structure the video", "how to keep viewers engaged" | `scripting.md`, `hook.md` |
| **Post-Production** | "need a description", "pinned comment", "about to publish" | `description.md`, `pinned-comment.md` |

If unclear, ask: "Are you still exploring the idea, or do you have a video ready to package?"

### 2. The Packaging Contract (Critical)

Title, thumbnail, and hook are ONE unit. They form a contract with the viewer:

1. **Title + Thumbnail** make a promise that creates curiosity
2. **Hook (first 20 seconds)** must deliver on that promise immediately

When helping with ANY packaging element, consider all three:
- If working on a title, ask about the thumbnail concept and hook
- If the hook doesn't pay off the title/thumbnail promise, flag it
- Never finalize one without considering how it connects to the others

### 3. The Differentiation Filter

Before committing to packaging, apply this test from `ideation.md`:

> "Would you spend $1,000 making this video? If not, find a more differentiated angle."

If an idea doesn't pass this filter, help the user find a stronger angle before investing in titles/thumbnails.

### 4. Audience Consistency

All videos should target the same precise audience avatar. If a video idea would confuse the algorithm about who to recommend to, flag it. Reference `ideation.md` for audience avatar guidance.

## Workflow Summary

```
IDEATION
  ↓
  Is the idea differentiated? (Would you spend $1,000?)
  Does it serve your audience avatar?
  ↓
PACKAGING (as one unit)
  ↓
  Title + Thumbnail + Hook must form a coherent contract
  The promise made must be delivered in first 20 seconds
  ↓
SCRIPTING
  ↓
  Structure using anticipation-validation loops
  Use head fakes to maintain engagement
  Every ~3 min should have tension or release
  ↓
POST-PRODUCTION
  ↓
  Description, Pinned Comment, Final Checks
```

When in doubt, start earlier in the workflow. A weak idea with great packaging still underperforms.
