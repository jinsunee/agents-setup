# Comprehensive Design Process

## Phase 1: Research & Strategy

**Goal:** Problem Definition & User Understanding

- **User Personas:** Create profiles based on demographics, goals, frustrations, and tech proficiency.
- **Journey Mapping:** Map the current user experience to identify friction points and opportunities.
- **Competitive Analysis:** Evaluate strengths/weaknesses of direct and indirect competitors.
- **Design Brief:** Define scope, timeline, and success metrics (KPIs).

## Phase 2: Information Architecture (IA) & Flow

**Goal:** Structure & Navigation

- **IA Diagrams:** Organize content hierarchy and navigation paths.
- **User Flows:** Visualize the path a user takes to complete a specific task (Happy path vs. Edge cases).
- **Low-Fidelity Wireframes:** Focus on layout and functionality without visual distraction (Grayscale only).

## Phase 3: UI Design & Systems

**Goal:** Visual Hierarchy & Fidelity

- **High-Fidelity Mockups:** Apply brand identity, color, and typography.
- **Design System:**
  - **Atoms:** Colors, Typography, Icons, Spacing (Grid/8pt system).
  - **Components:** Buttons, Inputs, Cards, Navigation bars.
  - **Patterns:** Forms, Modals, Empty states.
- **Microinteractions:** Design meaningful animations for feedback (hover, click, loading, success).
- **Responsive Design:** Define behavior for Mobile (360px+), Tablet (768px+), and Desktop (1024px+).

## Phase 4: Prototyping & Testing

**Goal:** Validation

- **Interactive Prototypes:** Link screens to simulate flows for testing (e.g., Figma/Protopie logic).
- **Usability Testing:** Conduct moderated/unmoderated tests. Record task success rates and time-on-task.
- **Iteration:** Refine design based on feedback loop.

## Phase 5: Developer Handoff

**Goal:** Implementation Support

- **Specs:** Provide redlines for margins, padding, and font styles.
- **Assets:** Export SVGs for icons, optimized PNG/WEBP for images.
- **Tokens:** Define semantic variables (e.g., `primary-color`, `spacing-m`) for code consistency.
